## Working Flow

1. **Web Scraping:**  
   The tool uses Python scripts (leveraging libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests) to automatically collect episode ratings from the IMDB website for a specified TV series.

2. **Data Processing:**  
   Extracted data is cleaned and structured using Python's data management libraries (such as Pandas).

3. **Visualization:**  
   The processed data is visualized using Matplotlib, generating insightful charts‚Äîsuch as line plots of ratings per episode/season.

4. **Output:**  
   Both tabular data (CSV/Excel) and visual plots (PNG/JPG) are saved for review and further use.
